## How to find developers

To find developers, one can use the following resources. The approach will evolve over so will this list.

* Hacker News "Who wants to be Hired" Thread. Posted at 11 AM Eastern time on the first weekday of every month.
    - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21419534 (search for any country or/and then technology)
    - Similarly, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21419535 (search here for SEEKING WORK)

* Dev.to listing. https://dev.to/listings
    - search for relevant tags(javascript, react, etc)

* Github Trending developers. https://github.com/trending/developers
    - apply language filter
    - Catch: Some devs are trending with repos which contain only README's, so make sure you see the content/code of the repo.
    - Another way, can be see trending github repos https://github.com/trending and then look for contributors in there. Bit tedious, but can give some good devs

* Use data aggregator built over github.
    - like http://git-awards.com/users?utf8=%E2%9C%93&type=city&language=javascript&city=New+delhi
    - Apply language and city filter
